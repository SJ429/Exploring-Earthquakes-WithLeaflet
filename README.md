# leaflet-challenge

This project pulls earthquake data from the USGS website. The dataset selected was all earthquakes for the past seven days. The javascript file "logic.js" pulls in the json data and generates a map using Leaflet and mapbox. Each cirle represents an earthquake and the size and color reflect the magnitude of the earthquake.
