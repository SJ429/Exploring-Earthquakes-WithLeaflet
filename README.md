# Earthquakes


 The purpose of this assignment was to use earthquake data from the USGS website and looked at the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.  


The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.



The dataset selected for this assignment was all earthquakes for the past seven days from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/1.0_day.geojson.

Also, data set from the tectonic plates from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates was used for this visualization.

 
Leaflet was used to create base maps and layer controls were added to allow the user to view the overlays and basemaps of choice. 

Each circle represents an earthquake's size and the magnitude of the earthquake.  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color and are reflected on the legend which is color coded according to the magnitude of the earthquakes.
